# UDMS
This repository is a monorepo for the Unified Device Management System, which integrates various components necessary for easy search of our SCCM devices via a Ruby script, a Rails-based web interface, and an iOS application. Each subproject is designed to operate both independently and together, offering a flexible approach to device management.
